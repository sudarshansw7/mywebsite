# Here's a quick summary of what the code does:

1 .Creates an S3 bucket.
2 .Sets ownership controls to "BucketOwnerPreferred."
3 .Configures public access settings to allow public ACLs, policies, and buckets (though you've set them to false,  which means these are not blocked).
4 .Sets ACLs for the bucket and uploaded objects to "public-read," making them publicly accessible.
5 .Uploads three objects: an index HTML file, an image directory (which should be a specific image file), and a CSS file.
6 .Configures the S3 bucket to serve a static website with an index document.
